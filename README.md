# Cracking The Coding Interview Notes And Question Answers
My notes and question answers to Cracking The Coding Interview 6th ed.

## Introduction I The Interview Process
- algos/coding biggest part of interview (problem solving)
- might only be one question - this is fine 
- talk through it
- let interviewer jump in if they want (doesn't mean you're doing poorly)
- assement bases on analytical skills, coding skills, technical knowledge / CS fundamentals, experience, culture fit
- they dont mind letting good candidates slip through
- use real code on whiteboard, not psuedocode
- what matters is that you do better than the other candidates
  - sometimes you can do poorly because it's a really hard question, but everyone else did too and you may still have done the best

## Introduction II Behind The Scenes
- 1-2 phone screens (coding/algos) with high bar
- on-site rounds (3-6)
  - one will be a lunch (non-technical)
  - questions: coding, algos, design/architecture, behavioral/experience
- follow up if they haven't responded in one week
- non-response means nothing. could still be a yes.
- microsoft
  - want smart geeks who are passionate about technology.
  - first you meet your recruiter
    - recruiter is your friend
    - there to prep you
  - may have a hiring manager meeting
    - call "as app", ie as appropriate
    - this means you passed and now it's up to the hiring manager
  - prepare for "why do you want to work at microsoft"
    - passionate about technology
    - "i've been using MS for as long as I can remember and I'm really impressed at how MS products are always great. Lately I've been using VS for programming and the APIs are excellent."
  - individual teams have more control since products are diverse. interviews can all be very different.
- amazon
  - phone screen with specific team. code in shared document.
  - on site interview with the specific team you'd be in
  - whiteboard coding
  - each interview has one area to probe
  - one interview may be really hard, the "bar raiser" interview.
    - bar raiser gets special training & has a veto
    - you may do poorly in this one, but if you do better than the other candidates, you may be fine
  - the interviewers then meet and make a yes/no decision
  - prep for scalability questions and OO
- google
  - phone screen. will write code in shared document. hard questions but doesnt really count towards final decision.
  - on site will be 4-6 interviews with one person each
  - on of them is lunch and is informal. ask questions.
  - each interview is random topics/questions, up to interviewer
  - written feedback goes to hiring committee (HC) for a yes/no recommendation to management
  - 4 categories: analytical ability, coding, experience and communication.
  - one interviewer must be give you a very high score

# Cracking The Coding Interview Notes And Question Answers
My notes and question answers to Cracking The Coding Interview 6th ed.

## Introduction I The Interview Process
- algos/coding biggest part of interview (problem solving)
- might only be one question - this is fine 
- talk through it
- let interviewer jump in if they want (doesn't mean you're doing poorly)
- assement bases on analytical skills, coding skills, technical knowledge / CS fundamentals, experience, culture fit
- they dont mind letting good candidates slip through
- use real code on whiteboard, not psuedocode
- what matters is that you do better than the other candidates
  - sometimes you can do poorly because it's a really hard question, but everyone else did too and you may still have done the best
